          <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
          <li>Maple syrup and butter, as desired, for serving</li>

        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</li>
          <li>In a small bowl, whisk milk and eggs; pour over flour mixture, and whisk gently to combine (don't overmix). Gently whisk in butter.</li>
          <li>Following manufacturer's instructions, cook waffles until deep brown and crisp. (For a standard waffle iron, pour a generous 1/2 cup of batter into center, spreading to within 1/2 inch of edges, and close; waffle will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.) Serve warm, with maple syrup and butter, as desired.</li>
