        <p><strong>Descriptions</strong></p>
        <p>Crepes are easier to make than you think. In fact, we believe crepes are even more simple—and versatile—than pancakes. They can be dressed up with sweet or savory toppings and any number of flavorful fillings for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert.<br>

        Crepe batter is thinner than pancake batter because it doesn't contain leavener (that's why crepes are thin, flat, and delicate). The batter for our simple crepe recipe comes together in the blender—which ensures a smooth crepe batter that has the consistency of heavy cream. Even better, you don't need a special crepe pan to cook them; simply use a nonstick skillet.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>1 ½ cups whole milk, room temperature</li>
          <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for brushing</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>In a blender, puree flour, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, and butter until smooth, about 30 seconds. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 1 day; stir for a few seconds before using.</li>
          <li>Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium. Lightly coat with butter. Quickly pour 1/4 cup batter into center of skillet, tilting and swirling pan until batter evenly coats bottom.</li>
          <li>Cook until crepe is golden in places on bottom and edges begin to lift from pan, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Use an offset spatula to lift one edge of crepe, then use your fingers to gently flip crepe.</li>
          <li>Cook crepe on second side until just set and golden in places on bottom, about 45 seconds. Slide crepe onto a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
          <li>Repeat with remaining batter, coating pan with more butter as needed, and stacking crepes directly on top of one another. Let cool to room temperature before using.</li>
